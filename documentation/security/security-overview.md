# Security Overview

## Security Architecture

The Julius Wirth website implements multiple layers of security to protect against common threats and ensure data integrity.

## Network Security

### Firewall Configuration
- **Technology**: UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- **Allowed Ports**: 
  - 22 (SSH) - Rate limited
  - 80 (HTTP) - Redirects to HTTPS
  - 443 (HTTPS) - Primary access
- **Default Policy**: Deny all incoming, allow outgoing

### DDoS Protection
- Rate limiting implemented at nginx level
- Connection limits per IP address
- SYN flood protection via kernel parameters

## Application Security

### SSL/TLS Configuration
- **Provider**: Let's Encrypt
- **Protocols**: TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3
- **HSTS**: Enabled with preload
- **Certificate Renewal**: Automated

### Security Headers
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

## Access Control

### SSH Access
- Key-based authentication only
- Password authentication disabled
- Root login disabled
- Limited user access

### Intrusion Prevention
- **Technology**: Fail2ban
- **Services Protected**: SSH, Nginx
- **Ban Duration**: 3600 seconds
- **Max Retries**: 3-5 depending on service

## Update Management

### Automated Updates
- Security patches: Automatic
- System updates: Manual approval
- Kernel updates: Manual with scheduled maintenance

### Backup Security
- Encrypted backups
- Multiple retention periods
- Offsite storage
- Regular integrity checks

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Log Management
- Centralized logging
- Log rotation with compression
- Retention period: 30 days
- Security event tracking

### Health Monitoring
- Service availability checks
- Resource utilization monitoring
- SSL certificate expiry alerts
- Failed authentication tracking

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance measures
- Data minimization practices
- Secure data transmission
- Regular security audits

### Security Standards
- OWASP best practices
- CIS benchmarks implementation
- Regular vulnerability assessments
- Incident response procedures

## Emergency Procedures

### Incident Response
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Assess impact and scope
3. Implement remediation
4. Document incident
5. Review and improve

### Recovery Procedures
- Automated backup restoration
- Service recovery scripts
- Configuration rollback capability
- Disaster recovery plan

## Security Contacts

For security concerns or to report vulnerabilities:
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Contact the security team directly
- Use encrypted communication when possible
